Code testing automation can be done using different tools. For the automation of user interface tests in web applications, a suitable tool is Selenium Web Driver. In this repository I will be adding new exercises. In each exercise I will use different functionalities offered by the Selenium framework.

1. Automated Fireforx Search. This is a basic script with first steps in Selenium Web Driver. The test consist in open firefox browser using geckodriver, go to Google, accept Google conditions and do an internet search. The test will pass if the browser page title is the same as the expected string.

2. Locators, WebElements and drivers error handling. In this script, the actions of going to the web, clicking a link, select an object, add it to cart and test if the price is equal to an expected result have been automated thanks to Selenium Web Driver, using geckodriver for Mozilla Firefox.

3. Filling Form. Fill a form interacting with different types of web elements (input text, checks, select option in select web element, select option in dynamic react dropdown list, scroll down to a specific element, submit) automatically with Java and Selenium Web Driver framework.

4. Frames, Waits, Alerts. Simple exercise to work on the concepts of implicit and explicit waits, frames and alert elements. It consists of clicking on a button, filling in a text field that appears in an alert prompt and accept. After that, checking the output (test), which must contain the text entered in the alert.
